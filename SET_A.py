    Alternative Approach Summary:
    1. Use a pre-trained language model for contextual understanding.

    3. Process user queries and input text directly through the language model.
    4. Implement techniques such as semantic search or knowledge distillation.
    5. Continuously evaluate and refine the model based on user feedback and performance metrics.
